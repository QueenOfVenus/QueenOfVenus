# Hi everybody 👋😉
### Allow me to introduce myself to you.

### Beyza...😆

I am a final year computer engineering student.

This is how I am most of the time when it comes to writing code...

But let it be.😅 I'm still in development.

## What am I interested in?

(It's a bit confusing there.😵)

Actually, I am currently interested in many fields at the amateur level and I am trying to improve myself. I'm still undecided on what field to specialize in.
    
  ### 1_)Robotic Coding (Arduino and IoT Technology)

Yes! Okay, let's say we're trying to get to know each other. But I'm sure we can come to an agreement.😜🤜🤛🤖

I received certified training on Arduino and IoT. I make small-scale applications to improve myself. I also did remote button control by connecting NodeMCU via Blynk.

   ### 2_)Web Frontend Design
  
Did I mention that my design talent is very strong? Very Strong...

I know HTML5, CSS ve Bootstrap 4.

Maybe this is my mood when designing. Yet the result is always perfect. Because I work hard to be perfect...

   ### 3_)Game Design (Character, Map, Scenario)
   
I am very new in this field. I decided to revive my creative and productive art skills in the game industry. Japanese animations and 3D FPS game characters, map designs attract my attention. I believe I can do good work in this industry. I am trying to learn Blender. 

I am also good at computer games.

  ### 4_)Cyber Securtiy
  
I don't know anything other than HackerTyper. My aim is not to be Elliot Alderson, just a little curiosity... I'm watching "Mr Robot" these days...😁
